            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, Welcome to my portfolio website. Myself Aditya Bhootra. I am currently pursuing B.tech in Civil Engineering in IIT Madras. 
                Because of the coding environment here in IIT Madras, I got drawn towards web-development and decided to become a software developer.
                Following this attracrion, I became a web-ops coordinator in SOC (Sports Organising Committee) of IIT Madars and designes a website with 
                3-4 other coordinators of the team. I also made some on my own. Here are the names and their Github links:-

                <p>In this project, I have built a location-based real estate website. 
                    It is a full stack web application with Django powering the backend and React Js the frontend.
                <br>I built the frontend very fast by using Material UI which is a very easy and intuitive React library for building UI components.
                I then built the API with Django Rest Framework (DRF) and I made requests to the API with React.
                I added a geographic aspect to this project by placing the property listings on a map. 
                I achieveD that with React-Leaflet which provides a binding between React and Leaflet library.
